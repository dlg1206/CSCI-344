### Phase 1 - Tokenizer
The tokenizer reads a Jott file and output an ArrayList<Token> representing the tokens in the provided file. The tokenization will be based on the DFA provided.

#### How to Build Project
In the projects testers directory `src/testers` run the following commands to compile and test the code:
```bash
javac JottTokenizerTest.java
```	
```bash
java JottTokenizerTest  
```
   This should compile and run the `JottTokenizerTest` file that tests the `JottTokenizer` main class.
